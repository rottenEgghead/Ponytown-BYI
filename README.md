## Do Not Interact
Just don't be a bad person. A bad person in my book includes...
* Someone who supports / commits to morally problematic people, acts, groups, etc
* Is morally problematic.

and whatnot that hasn't been mentioned. Also, don't ask to copy my pony, all of my ponies (unless given perms) should not be copied.

## Extra Information
* **None of my avatars,** unless given explicit permission, **are to be copied. Do not share screenshots of my avatar to other platforms without my permission. Anyone that copies my avatars WILL be outed and hidden.**
* If we share common interests (as seen in [my about me page](https://github.com/rottenEgghead/About-Me/blob/main/README.md)), please interact! I like making mutuals with similar interests.
* I hang out around the spawn, the bakery, and the docks in the Safe English server.
* I tend to type with grammar, but I make mistakes often.
